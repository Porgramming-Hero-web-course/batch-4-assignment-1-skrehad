**Union Type:**  
A union type enables a variable to hold one of several specified types, giving flexibility in its usage. For example, if a variable is defined as `string | number | boolean`, it can accept either a string or a number. This is similar to an `OR` condition, meaning if the value matches any one of the given types, the operation proceeds smoothly.For example---

{
let value: string | number;
value = "Hello";  
 value = 123;  
}

**Intersection Type:**
An intersection type combines multiple types into a single one, so the variable must include properties from all types involved. For instance, if a variable is of type `information1 & information2`, it will inherit the characteristics of both types `information1` and `information2`. This works like an `AND` condition, meaning all type requirements must be satisfied for it to be valid.
For example---

{
type information1 = { name: string }
type information2 = { age: number }

    type Person = information1 & information2;

    let person: Person = {
      name: "Rehad",
      age: 22
    }

}

**Significance:**  
Union and Intersection Types are essential for making TypeScript code more adaptable and precise. They provide better control over variable types, ensuring that variables are both flexible and secure in their intended operations.
